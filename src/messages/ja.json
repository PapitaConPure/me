        "qnaQ1": "なぜ「Papita / パピタ・コン・プレ」と名乗るのですか?",
        "qnaA1": "It's a name written in Spanish, meaning \"Lil Potato with Mashed Potatoes\". One morning many years ago, aroud 3AM, I was making an account on some game to play with friends. Thing is, I was hungry as heck, a bit sleepy, and was also already thinking of replacing my older nickname. That's how it came to exist.\n\n\"Papita con Puré\" doesn't really make sense, even in Spanish. It's just a combo of two foods you can't really combine. However, it's still funny, and people that don't speak Spanish can call me \"Papita\" and it doesn't sound half bad.",
        "qnaQ2": "ゲームをSteamにアップロードすることを考えたことはありますか?",
        "qnaA2": "Getting your game on Steam costs an upfront of US$100. It's something I strongly desire, but having a page there will have to wait.",
        "qnaQ3": "自分の音楽をSpotifyやSoundCloudにアップロードすることを考えたことはありますか?",
        "qnaA3": "I have no intentions of doing that right now. With just a YouTube channel I feel pretty comfortable, for now.\n\nHowever, <1>ZFF</1> uploads my music to SoundCloud every once in a while.\n\nAlso, if I participate in collabs and another person uploads the music, there's a chance it may be on SoundCloud/Spotify/other, as I have no issues with that.",
